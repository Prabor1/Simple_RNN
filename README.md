# Simple_RNN

I trained a simple Recurrent Neural Network which can take string of numbers as input and solve additin or substraction.   
Input will be like `"55+40"` and the model will predict the output `95`.    
If the input is iike `"55-40"`, model should predict `15`.     
The hyperparameter are choosen in such a manner so that it can predict 100% correct. There is no dataset given, as I could not find any. So I have created some data using numpy random function.
